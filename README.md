# Water-Potability---Machine-Learning-project-Python

In 2020, 1 out of 4 people did not have access to a source of drinking water in the world. Contaminated water is linked to the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea or Hepatitis A.

We are going to develop a prediction model of its potability in Python.

This project has been carried out during The Bridge Data Science Bootcamp in september 2021.
